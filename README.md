ðŸŽ° Piper's Blackjack Crack Shack â€“ Python CLI Casino
The One and Only Crack Shack â€“ Where the cards are hotter than the Crack!

Welcome to Black Jack
The chips are black and it's the year 2400.
If you like crack and playing Black Jack You're in the right place. 
ATM on depend drinks however, BYOB

Multiples decks if you want more than one before we embrace card counters
and those embrace the outer worlds. We got a UI system so their, playing blackjack
while cracks back. Yup, that's right. Black Jack and Crack are all the rage in 2400.

I woke up one morning and found myself a few years behind.
No one was smoking grass and there were people who wrote with pen and pencil
and talked about shit like work. 

It's the year 2400. We care about:

Black Jack. Crack. And what's inbetween. If your with me your with me.

Sincercly yours,
George Piper the 14th, just missed the lucky number.

that's aan important step. I lost my bird years ago. They began to say the second hand smoke
blew that poor birds lungs away. That's when I started walking the streets, counting cards until
I was kicked out of every god damn casino miles from the middle where you throw your life away.

Instead, I laid in a box, holding my last rocks, hoping they wouldn't reconinize.
I had took em for all they had besides the house, but my investments failed. 
The crack fad of 2207, when crack was first legalized proposed the opposite of what occured after 
enlongation. People smoked crack for fun. On the weekend. But then birds died. Mine died. George the 16th.

To him I dedicate my partial will,
with love
George P the 14
